HTML - is  a tool we use to create websites.
HTML - giving instructions to a computer.

<button></button>
<p></p>
these are HTML elements.
Element is a generic term that we used to describe anything that we can display on web page.

Syntax - is a rule for writing code.

HTML syntax rules-
<button> - html tag - tells computer what we trying to create.
button -  tag name(what kind of element we are trying to create)

every element consists with 2 tags. opening tag <button>  and closing tag </button>.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com"></a>

https://www.youtube.com is a html attribute. it modifies how an element behaves.

href - attribute name
inside it has the value.

target="_blank" attribute defines

extra spaces and extra new lines are ignored in html.


---VS code hacks---
if you want to change the indent view, click on the spaces tab below the vs code and change the view. by default it is 4.

CSS - is used to change the appearance of HTML elements.

CSS Syntax rules-

<style>
    button{
        background-color: red;
    }
</style>


button{ ---- css selector. (which element we are targeting.)

background-color:    css property
red;     css value


.subscribe-button:hover {
        background-color: green;
    }

:hover ---> is considered as pseudo class - (add styles in a certain situation)

transition: opacity 0.15s;
(normally we add 0.15s transiton - transition means how smoothly opacity changes)


CSS box model ----
 using padding-top,bottom,left,right is an alternative method for adding width and height for a button or other element.

by default buttons are aligns based on the text inside the button on the browser. if buttons are not aligns in same line,



Text styles ----

html entity middle dot code ---- 
	&#183;

html entity check mark ----
	&#10003;

paragraph tag (<p></p>) by default comes with a margin at the top and bottom.

CSS Specificity -----

css styles have priority order.
the selector that's more specific has higher priority.

Text element -

element that is inside the text.
(style specific part of a text)
Ex: <span>, <u>
we can add classes and style them for spans also.

if we want to add white space between texts, we can use margin-left/right element.


<!DOCTYPE html>
this tells browser to use modern version of the html.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head></head>
    <body></body>
</html>
This is the proper structure of any html file.

<html>
    <head></head>
nested elements - elements inside other elements.

every web page has only one <html> element.

all the visible elements on a web page should go inside <body></body> element.
other not visible elements should go inside <head></head> element.

<link> element does not require a closing tag. these kind of elements are called void elements.

CSS display property---

in html, there are 3 types of elements.
1. block element- takes up the entire line (paragraph by default a block element  )
2. Inline block element - only takes up as much space as needed. it doesn't take entire line.
ex. for inline block elements-  image element, text element. those don't take entire line. it takes only needed space.
3. Inline element (basically just text elements) - appear within a line of text.
ex: <strong></strong>

<div> element ---
div means divison. it's just a box. div is by default a block element.

what's special about div? div can contain other elements inside. ex: <p>, images, inputs etc.
div's are containers. containers allow group elements together.
<div> = containers

Nested Layouts -
	laypouts inside layouts

CSS grid ----

Grid is a layout that has columns and rows.
grids maintain alignments much better.

fr =  free space - it takes remaining space 

style="
            margin-top: 30px;
            display: grid;
            grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
            column-gap: 20px;
            row-gap: 40px;
            "

CSS flexbox--
another way to create layouts. similar to css grid. 

flex box means flexible boxes.
